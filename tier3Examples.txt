The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated with the formula a (side one) squared + b (side two) squared = c (the hypotenuse) squared. In this case that would be ! squared + £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated with the formula a (side one) squared + b (side two) squared = c (the hypotenuse) squared. In this case that would be ! squared + £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated with the formula (side one) a squared + b (side two) squared = c (the hypotenuse) squared. In this case that would be ! squared + £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of side one (or a) can be calculated by altering the formula for hypotenuse questions to make a new one, which is c (the hypotenuse) squared - b (side two) squared = a squared. In this case that would be ! squared - £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of side one (or a) can be calculated by altering the formula for hypotenuse questions to make a new one, which is c (the hypotenuse) squared - b (side two) squared = a squared. In this case that would be ! squared - £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of side one (or a) can be calculated by altering the formula for hypotenuse questions to make a new one, which is c (the hypotenuse) squared - b (side two) squared = a squared. In this case that would be ! squared - £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of side two (or b) can be calculated by altering the formula for hypotenuse questions to make a new one, which is c (the hypotenuse) squared - a (side one) squared = b squared. In this case that would be ! squared - £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of side two (or b) can be calculated by altering the formula for hypotenuse questions to make a new one, which is c (the hypotenuse) squared - a (side one) squared = b squared. In this case that would be ! squared - £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
The length of side two (or b) can be calculated by altering the formula for hypotenuse questions to make a new one, which is c (the hypotenuse) squared - a (side one) squared = b squared. In this case that would be ! squared - £ squared. We then find the square root of this calculation, which in this case gets us / cm
