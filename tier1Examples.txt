The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have a square, with each of its sides being x cm long. As a square has four sides, we do x + x + x + x (or x*4) which gets us / cm

The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have an isosceles triangle, with side one being y cm long, and sides two and three being z cm long. So we do y + z + z (or y + z*2) which gets us / cm
The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have an isosceles triangle, with side one being y cm long, and sides two and three being z cm long. So we do y + z + z (or y + z*2) which gets us / cm
The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have a rectangle, with sides one and two being x cm long, and sides three and four being y cm long. So we do x + x + y + y (or x*2 + y*2) which gets us / cm
The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have a rectangle, with sides one and two being x cm long, and sides three and four being y cm long. So we do x + x + y + y (or x*2 + y*2) which gets us / cm
The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have a trapezium, with side one being y cm long, side two being k cm long, side three being ? cm long and side four being ! cm long. so we do y + k + ? + ! which gets us / cm
The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have a trapezium, with side one being y cm long, side two being k cm long, side three being ? cm long and side four being ! cm long. so we do y + k + ? + ! which gets us / cm
The perimeter of shapes can be calculated through adding up all their sides. In this case, we have a scalene triangle, with side one being y cm long, side two being z cm long and side three being k cm long. So we do y + z + k which gets us / cm
