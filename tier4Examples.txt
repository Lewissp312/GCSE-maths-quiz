The missing angles can be calculated with SOHCAHTOA. In this case, we have side 1 (the adjacent, as it's the side closest to the angle apart from the hypotenuse) and the base (the opposite, as it's the side opposite the angle). We then refer to SOHCAHTOA which tells us that we should divide the opposite by the adjacent, which in this case would be £ divided by !. We then use the inverse of tan (the T part) on the result which gets us / degrees
